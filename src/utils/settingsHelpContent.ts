  // Print Speed
  printSpeed: {
    brief: 'Default movement speed during printing',

  // Bridge Fan Speed
  bridgeFanSpeed: {
    brief: 'Fan speed boost when printing bridges',

  firstLayerHeight: {
    brief: 'Thickness of the first printed layer',

  // ── Cooling ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  fanFullLayer: { brief: 'Layer number at which fan reaches full speed', detailed: 'Ramps up the fan gradually to avoid thermal shock on early layers. Layers 4–8 typical. Reaching full fan speed too soon can cause warping or delamination in ABS.' },
  minPrintSpeed: { brief: 'Minimum speed when slowing for min layer time', detailed: 'If the printer slows for min layer time, this is the slowest it will go. Prevents stopping completely, which causes heat buildup and material degradation at the nozzle.' },
  liftHeadEnabled: { brief: 'Move printhead away to let small layers cool', detailed: 'When a layer needs longer to cool than its print time, the printhead moves away to avoid heating it. Helps tall, narrow prints cool properly.' },
  enableBridgeFan: { brief: 'Enable extra cooling during bridge sections', detailed: 'Activates special fan speed when printing bridges. Maximum cooling on bridges helps the material solidify quickly, preventing sagging.' },

  regularFanSpeedAtHeight: { brief: 'Height at which fan reaches regular speed', detailed: 'Alternative to layer number — sets the height in mm at which the fan hits regular speed. Useful when you know the exact height rather than layer count.' },
  fanKickstartTime: { brief: 'Duration to run fan at 100% to start spinning', detailed: 'Some fans need a kick-start burst to begin spinning. Runs the fan at full speed for this many milliseconds, then drops to the set speed. 100–200ms typical.' },
  maximumFanSpeed: { brief: 'Maximum allowed fan speed (%)', detailed: 'Caps the fan speed at this percentage. Useful for printers where 100% fan is too aggressive for the material (e.g., ABS warps with full cooling). 70–100% for PLA, 30–50% for ABS.' },
  initialFanSpeed: { brief: 'Fan speed for the very first layers', detailed: 'The fan speed during the initial layers before it ramps up. Usually 0% to let the first layers bond to the bed without rapid cooling, which can cause warping.' },
  buildVolumeFanSpeed: { brief: 'Speed for the enclosure/build volume fan', detailed: 'Controls a separate fan for the printer enclosure (if present). A slow enclosure fan can maintain higher ambient temperatures for materials like ABS.' },

  // ── Special Modes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  relativeExtrusion: { brief: 'Use relative E commands in G-code (M83)', detailed: 'In relative mode, E values in G-code are distances to extrude, not absolute positions. Some printers require this. Most Marlin printers can use either mode.' },
  spiralizeContour: { brief: 'Print as a continuous spiral — no seam (vase mode)', detailed: 'Vase mode creates a single continuous spiral with no seams, perfect for hollow vessels. The model must have no overhangs and only one wall is printed.' },

  // ── Acceleration ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  accelerationPrint: { brief: 'Acceleration during printing moves', detailed: 'Lower values (1000–2000 mm/s²) reduce ringing and vibration artifacts. Higher values (3000+) print faster but may cause visible ghosting on walls at high speeds.' },
  accelerationTravel: { brief: 'Acceleration during travel moves', detailed: 'Travel moves can use higher acceleration (3000–5000 mm/s²) since no material is being deposited. Higher travel acceleration reduces time on non-printing moves.' },

  // ── Mesh Fixes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  unionOverlappingVolumes: { brief: 'Merge overlapping model volumes into one solid', detailed: 'When enabled, intersecting volumes are treated as a single object (union).

  maxTravelResolution: { brief: 'Minimum segment length for travel path approximation', detailed: 'Like max resolution but for travel moves. Slightly larger value (0.8mm) is fine since travel paths are not extruding material.' },

  // ── Dimensional Compensation ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  horizontalExpansion: { brief: 'Expand or shrink all horizontal dimensions', detailed: 'Positive values make the model larger; negative make it smaller. Used to calibrate dimensional accuracy. If a 20mm part prints as 20.2mm, use -0.1mm expansion.' },
  elephantFootCompensation: { brief: 'Reduce first-layer spreading (elephant foot)', detailed: 'The first layer often spreads slightly wider than designed ("elephant foot"). Positive values compensate by printing the first layer slightly narrower. 0.1–0.2mm typical.' },
