# AI Assistant Example Transcripts

These examples show the intended conversation shape for MCP clients such as Claude Code or other local agents. Tool results are shortened for readability.

## Design A Phone Stand

User:

```text
Design a simple phone stand for a 75 mm wide phone. It should lean back 12 degrees, have a front lip, and fit on a small printer.
```

Assistant:

```text
I will make a compact stand with a slanted back, a base, and a small front retaining lip. I will keep the footprint under 100 x 80 mm.
```

Tool calls:

```text
designcad_status()
create_box({ "x": 90, "y": 70, "z": 6, "px": 0, "py": 0, "pz": 3 })
create_box({ "x": 86, "y": 6, "z": 12, "px": 0, "py": -28, "pz": 9 })
start_sketch({ "plane": "XZ" })
sketch_polygon({ "points": [[-41, 0], [41, 0], [41, 72], [26, 72], [-41, 12]] })
finish_sketch()
extrude_sketch({ "sketchId": "back-profile-sketch-id", "depth": 6, "operation": "new-body" })
transform({ "id": "back-rest-id", "ty": 18 })
fillet_edges({ "objectId": "base-id", "edgeIds": ["top-front", "top-left", "top-right"], "radius": 2 })
snapshot_view()
```

Assistant:

```text
The stand is blocked out: 90 mm wide, 70 mm deep, with a 12 mm lip and a tilted back support. I added small top-edge fillets so it is nicer to handle. The shape should fit common compact build plates.
```

Follow-up user:

```text
Add cable clearance in the center of the front lip.
```

Tool calls:

```text
create_box({ "x": 18, "y": 10, "z": 16, "px": 0, "py": -29, "pz": 9 })
boolean_subtract({ "targetId": "front-lip-id", "toolId": "clearance-cutter-id" })
snapshot_view()
```

Assistant:

```text
I added an 18 mm center notch through the lip for a charging cable and checked the viewport again.
```

## Add 3 mm Fillet To All Top Edges

User:

```text
Add a 3 mm fillet to all top edges of the selected part.
```

Assistant:

```text
I will inspect the selected object, identify the top perimeter edges, then apply a constant 3 mm fillet.
```

Tool calls:

```text
list_objects()
get_object_properties({ "id": "selected-feature-id" })
fillet_edges({
  "objectId": "selected-feature-id",
  "edgeIds": ["edge-top-1", "edge-top-2", "edge-top-3", "edge-top-4"],
  "radius": 3
})
snapshot_view()
```

Assistant:

```text
The top perimeter now has a 3 mm fillet. I left the bottom edges sharp so the part still sits flat on the build plate.
```

## Prepare A Printable Export

User:

```text
Export this bracket as STL and then slice it with the active printer profile.
```

Tool calls:

```text
list_objects()
export_stl({ "ids": ["bracket-body-id"] })
export_gcode({})
```

Assistant:

```text
I exported the bracket body as STL and started G-code export with the active printer profile.
```

## Notes For Client Authors

Use `list_objects` and `get_object_properties` before changing an existing design. Prefer ids over visible names when calling editing tools. Use `snapshot_view` after geometry changes so the assistant can catch obvious placement, scale, or selection mistakes before continuing.
