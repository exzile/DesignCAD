## Overview

DesignCAD combines design, print preparation, and printer interaction in one browser workspace.

| Workspace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Design** | Sketching, solid modeling, imports/exports, feature timeline, and component organization. |
| **Prepare** | Plate setup, slicer-oriented model inspection, calibration utilities, and G-code preview. |
| **Printer** | Duet/RepRapFirmware-style printer connection, monitoring, file handling, and update-oriented flows. |
| **Self-hosting** | Static Nginx deployment with an optional local updater service for Orange Pi style installs. |

The project is evolving quickly. Some CAD and slicer features are experimental, but the repository is public so the implementation can be inspected, used, and improved in the open.

## Feature Highlights

### CAD And Modeling

- 3D viewport with orbit, pan, zoom, and view-cube style navigation.
- Sketching on XY, XZ, and YZ planes.
- Sketch tools including line, circle, rectangle, arc, and text workflows.
- Solid operation dialogs for extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, shell, rib, split, draft, hole, thread, chamfer, fillet, and related modeling actions.
- Mesh, surface, construction, inspect, assemble, and utilities ribbon areas.
- Component tree, feature timeline, selection filters, and visibility controls.

### Import And Export

- Import support for `.f3d`, `.step`, `.stp`, `.stl`, and `.obj`.
- Project/settings bundle flows for saving and loading workspace state.
- Export dialog for generated project/model outputs.

### Slicer And Preview

- Prepare workspace for slicer-focused workflows.
- Plate and model management.
- Calibration utilities.
- G-code preview and layer inspection.
- WASM-backed geometry/slicer helpers.

### Printer Workflows

- Printer workspace for Duet/RepRapFirmware-style devices.
- Printer profile and connection settings.
- Firmware/update-related UI flows.
- File and status panels for connected printers.

## Tech Stack

| Area | Tools |
|------|-------|
| UI | React 19, TypeScript, Lucide React |
| 3D | Three.js, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei` |
| State | Zustand |
| Build | Vite 8 |
| Tests | Vitest, Testing Library |
| Quality | ESLint, TypeScript composite builds |
| Geometry/runtime | WASM assets for selected geometry and slicer operations |

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Node.js `22.12.0` or newer
- npm
- A modern browser with WebGL support

Use the expected Node major version if you have `nvm`:

```bash
nvm use
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## Use Your Own Claude With DesignCAD

DesignCAD can expose the active browser session as a local MCP server so users can drive CAD actions with their own assistant subscription. In development, start the app with `npm run dev`, open `http://localhost:5173`, then use the AI MCP status badge in the status bar to copy the pairing command:

```text
claude mcp add designcad http://localhost:5174/mcp?token=...
```

The browser tab must stay open because tool calls are relayed into the running DesignCAD session. The MCP server is localhost-only, protected by a pairing token, rate-limited per tool, and includes an activity log in the status badge. Rotate the token from the badge if a pairing line is shared accidentally.

The MCP surface includes document inspection, primitive creation, sketches, common feature operations, booleans, transforms, exports, viewport snapshots, and read-only resources. See [docs/ai-mcp-tools.md](docs/ai-mcp-tools.md) for the tool reference and [docs/ai-examples.md](docs/ai-examples.md) for sample assistant transcripts.

An optional BYOK in-app chat panel is planned as a thin client over the same MCP tool surface for users who prefer Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter API keys inside the app. API keys should remain per-installation secrets and should only be sent to the selected provider.

## Development Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite development server. |
| `npm run dev:fresh` | Clear Vite optimized dependency cache, then start dev server. Useful after dependency, WASM, or persisted-state changes. |
| `npm run build` | Typecheck and build production static files into `dist/`. |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally with Vite preview. |
| `npm run clean` | Remove `dist/`. |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run the composite TypeScript build check. |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint. |
| `npm run test` | Run Vitest in watch mode. |
| `npm run test:run` | Run the Vitest suite once. |
| `npm run test:ui` | Start the Vitest UI. |
| `npm run verify` | Run `tsc -b` and `vitest run`. |
| `npm run check:wasm-budget` | Check WASM asset budget. |
| `npm run verify:wasm-build` | Verify the WASM build artifacts. |

```

Ignored local/private folders include `gcodes/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `memory/`, `.gitnexus/`, `obj/`, `node_modules/`, and `dist/`.

## Production Builds

Build static files:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output:

```text
dist/
```

The production build is a static single-page app. Any static host can serve it as long as unknown routes fall back to `index.html`.

## Orange Pi Hosting

DesignCAD can be served from an Orange Pi 3 LTS or similar small Linux board. For small SD cards, build on your development machine and copy only `dist/` to the board.

Recommended base packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y nginx git curl ufw fail2ban rsync ca-certificates
sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
```

Firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable
```

Example Nginx site:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    root /var/www/designcad;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    location /assets/ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        access_log off;
        expires 30d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
}
```

Deploy:

```bash
npm run build
rsync -av --delete dist/ user@device:/var/www/designcad/
```

## Self-Updater Service

The repository includes an optional updater service for a self-hosted Orange Pi deployment:

```text
scripts/designcad-updater.mjs
scripts/install-orangepi-updater.sh
```

The service exposes local endpoints through Nginx:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/update/status` | Check the installed version against the latest GitHub release. |
| `POST /api/update/apply` | Install the latest release asset. |

The web app includes an **Updates** panel that can talk to this local service.

Install from a checked-out repo on the Pi:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install-orangepi-updater.sh
```

The installer creates:

```text
/opt/designcad/updater/designcad-updater.mjs
/etc/designcad-updater/updater.env
/etc/designcad-updater/token
/var/lib/designcad-updater/state.json
designcad-updater.service
```

Updater environment variables are documented in `.env.example`. The browser update panel uses the local updater key from `/etc/designcad-updater/token`.

## Release Assets

The updater installs only the latest GitHub release asset. It does not update from `master`.

For faster and more reliable device updates, publish a release asset named like:

```text
designcad-dist.zip
```

Accepted archive layouts:

```text
index.html
assets/
```

or:

```text
dist/index.html
dist/assets/
```

Release updates download and install already-built static files, avoiding a full `npm ci && npm run build` on the device.

## Quality And Testing

Recommended checks before submitting code:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:run
npm run build
```

Faster pre-check during development:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

The slicer and geometry tests are intentionally detailed because small numerical changes can affect generated toolpaths, preview alignment, or dimensional accuracy.
